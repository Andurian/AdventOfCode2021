# Advent of Code 2021

My attempts at solving Advent of Code 2021 in Clojure. I had no knowledge of Clojure before and used this as an opportunity to learn the basics.

I am sure there are many errors and shortcomings when it comes to effective use of that language. Some tasks require way too long to execute and I have not figured out when to use maps, types or records and stuck to maps so far. These have precomputed results printed when running the main executable.

## Usage

    $ java -jar advent_of_code_2021-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]
